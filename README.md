    Deal or No Deal: Data Analysis
    This project analyzes player behavior and outcomes from the game show Deal or No Deal, using real episode data. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and explores how player decisions compare to the expected value of remaining briefcases, how bank offers vary over rounds, and whether accepting a deal was rational.

    Contents:
        - Exploratory Data Analysis of game episodes
        - Calculation of expected values at each round
        - Comparison between the bank's offer and expected value
        - Assessment of player decisions (Deal or No Deal) and whether they were optimal
        - Visualizations to illustrate trends and insights

    Dataset:
        The dataset includes information from multiple episodes of Deal or No Deal:
            - Values remaining in play during each round
            - Banker's offer at each decision point
            - Whether the player accepted the deal
            - Outcome had they continued playing

    ðŸ“Œ Note: The data is preloaded within the notebook. No external files are needed to run the analysis.

    Requirements:
        The project uses standard Python data science libraries:
            - pandas
            - numpy
            - matplotlib
            - seaborn
        You can use the following command to install any libraries you do not have downloaded: 
            - pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    
    Analysis Questions:
        - Do players behave rationally when choosing Deal or No Deal?
        - How close are bank offers to the expected value?
        - Are early deals usually better or worse than waiting?
    Example Visualizations:
        - Bank offer vs Expected Value
        - Distribution of deal outcomes
        - Cases where the player made a better or worse decision
